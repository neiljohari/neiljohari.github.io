# About Me
Hello! My name is Neil Johari, and I’m a student at the University of Michigan.

I am currently an Instructional Aide for the [Engineering 100 class on
Electronics for Atmospheric and Space
Measurements](https://eng100.engin.umich.edu/list/section-950/), where I develop
high quality videos and lab manuals published under [Hands on
Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCENsrYk8n9EKb4PY6B0s82A/videos).

I am passionate about programming, and recently I’ve been interested in web
development with Rails. [Check out my GitHub](https://github.com/neiljohari) to
see my open source contributions!

You can [check out my resume here](/assets/files/resume/resume.pdf), and email me at [neil@johari.tech](mailto:neil@johari.tech).
